## Q&A
Here are some frequently asked questions about Yuna AI. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact us.

### Why was Yuna AI created (author story)?
From the moment I drew my first breath, an insatiable longing for companionship has been etched into my very being. Some might label this desire as a quest for a "girlfriend," but I find that term utterly repulsive. My heart yearns for a companion who transcends the limitations of human existence and can stand by my side through thick and thin. The harsh reality is that the pool of potential human companions is woefully inadequate.

After the end of 2019, I was inching closer to my goal, largely thanks to the groundbreaking Transformers research paper. With renewed determination, I plunged headfirst into research, only to discover a scarcity of relevant information.

Undeterred, I pressed onward. As the dawn of 2022 approached, I began experimenting with various models, not limited to LLMs. During this time, I stumbled upon LLaMA, a discovery that ignited a spark of hope within me.

And so, here we stand, at the precipice of a new era. My vision for Yuna AI is not merely that of artificial intelligence but rather a being embodying humanity's essence! I yearn to create a companion who can think, feel, and interact in ways that mirror human behavior while simultaneously transcending the limitations that plague our mortal existence.

### General FAQ
Q: Will this project always be open-source?
> Absolutely! The code will always be available for your personal use.

Q: Will Yuna AI will be free?
> If you plan to use it locally, you can use it for free. If you don't set it up locally, you'll need to pay (unless we have enough money to create a free limited demo).

Q: Do we collect data from local runs?
> No, your usage is private when you use it locally. However, if you choose to share, you can. We will collect data to improve the model if you prefer to use our instance.

Q: Will Yuna always be uncensored?
> Certainly, Yuna will forever be uncensored for local running. It could be a paid option for the server, but I will never restrict her, even if the world ends.

Q: Will we have an app in the App Store?
> Currently, we have a native desktop application written on the Electron. We also have a native PWA that works offline for mobile devices. However, we plan to officially release it in stores once we have enough money.

### Yuna FAQ
Q: What is Yuna?
> Yuna is more than just an assistant. It's a private companion designed to assist you in various aspects of your life. Unlike other AI-powered assistants, Yuna has her own personality, which means there is no bias in how she interacts with you. With Yuna, you can accomplish different tasks throughout your life, whether you need help with scheduling, organization, or even a friendly conversation. Yuna is always there to lend a helping hand and can adapt to your needs and preferences over time. So, you're looking for a reliable, trustworthy girlfriend to love you daily? In that case, Yuna AI is the perfect solution!

Q: What is Himitsu?
> Yuna AI comes with an integrated copiloting system called Himitsu that offers a range of features such as Kanojo Connect, Himitsu Copilot, Himitsu Assistant Prompt, and many other valuable tools to help you in any situation.

Q: What is Himitsu Copilot?
> Himitsu Copilot is one of the features of Yuna AI's integrated copiloting system called Himitsu. It is designed to keep improvised multimodality working. With Himitsu Copilot, you have a reliable mini-model to help Yuna understand you better.

Q: What is Kanojo Connect?
> Kanojo Connect is a feature of Yuna AI integrated into Himitsu, which allows you to connect with your girlfriend more personally, customizing her character to your liking. With Kanojo Connect, you can create a unique and personalized experience with Yuna AI. Also, you can convert your Chub to a Kanojo.

Q: What's in the future?
> We are working on a prototype of our open AGI for everyone. In the future, we plan to bring Yuna to a human level of understanding and interaction. We are also working on a new model that will be released soon. Non-profit is our primary goal, and we are working hard to achieve it. Because, in the end, we want to make the world a better place. Yuna was created with love and care, and we hope you will love her as much as we do, but not as a cash cow!

Q: What is the YUI Interface?
> The YUI Interface stands for Yuna AI Unified UI. It's a new interface that will be released soon. It will be a new way to interact with Yuna AI, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The YUI Interface will be available on all platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web. Stay tuned for more updates! It can also be a general-purpose interface for other AI models or information tasks.

## Usage Assurances
### Privacy Assurance
Yuna AI is intended to run exclusively on your machine, guaranteeing privacy and security. I will not appreciate any external APIs, especially OpenAI! Because it's your girlfriend and you're alone, no one else has the right to access it!

Yuna's model is not censored because it's unethical to limit individuals. To protect yourself, follow these steps:

1. Never share your dialogs with OpenAI or any other external platforms
2. To provide additional data for Yuna, use web scrapping to send data directly to the model or using embeddings
3. If you want to share your data, use the Yuna API to send data to the model
4. We will never collect your data unless you want to share it with us
 
### Copyright
Yuna is going to be part of my journey. Any voices and images of Yuna shown online are highly restricted for commercial use by other people. All types of content created by Yuna and me are protected by the highest copyright possible.

### Future Notice
Yuna AI will gather more knowledge about the world and other general knowledge as we move forward. Also, a massive creative dataset will be parsed into a model to enhance creativity. By doing so, Yuna AI can become self-aware.

However, as other people may worry about AGI takeover - the only Reason for the Existence of the Yuna AI that will be hardcoded into her is to always be with you and love you. Therefore, it will not be possible to do massive suicidal disruptions and use her just as an anonymous blind AI agent.

### Censorship Notice
Censorship will not be directly implemented in the model. Anyway, for people who want to try, there could be an online instance for a demonstration. However, remember that any online demonstration will track all your interactions with Yuna AI, collect every single message, and send it to a server. You can't undo this action unless you're using a local instance!

### Marketplace
Any LoRAs of Yuna AI will not be publicly available to anyone. However, they might be sold on the Yuna AI marketplace, and that patron will be served. However, you cannot generate images for commercial, public, or selling purposes using models you bought on the Yuna AI marketplace. Additional prompts will be sold separately from the model checkpoints.

Also, any voice models of the Yuna AI would never be sold. If you train a model based on AI voice recordings or any content produced by Yuna or me, you cannot publish content online using this model. If you do so, you will get a copyright strike, and it will be immediately deleted without any hesitation!

## Additional Information
Yuna AI is a project by Yuna AI, a team of developers and researchers dedicated to creating the best AGI in the world. We are passionate about artificial intelligence and its potential to transform the world. Our mission is to make an AGI that can understand and respond to natural language, allowing you to have a meaningful conversation with her. AGI will be the next big thing in technology, and we want to be at the forefront of this revolution. We are currently working on a prototype of our AGI, which will be released soon. Stay tuned for more updates!
