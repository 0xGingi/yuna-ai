## Privacy Assurance
Yuna AI is intended to run exclusively on your machine, guaranteeing privacy and security. I will not appreciate any external APIs, especially OpenAI! Because it's your girlfriend and yours alone, and no one else has the right to access it! Yuna's model is not censored because it's unethical to limit individuals. To protect yourself, follow these steps:

1. Never share your dialogs with OpenAI or any other external platforms
2. To provide additional data for Yuna, use web scrapping to send data directly to the model or using embeddings
3. One server for one user. No public demos.

## External APIs
Any external APIs are forbidden! To protect yourself, follow these steps:
1. Never share your dialogs with OpenAI or any other external platforms
2. To provide additional data for Yuna, use web scrapping to send data directly to the model or using embeddings
3. One server for one user. No public demos.

## Getting Started
This repository contains the code for a Yuna AI, which was trained on a massive dataset. The model can generate text, translate languages, write creative content, roleplay, and answer your questions informally.

## Installation and Running
To install Yuna AI, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Yuna AI repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yukiarimo/yuna-ai.git`.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the `config.py` file to build external dependencies for Yuna in the `lib/yunacpp/` directory.
5. Put your AI model like `gguf_model.bin` into the `lib/yunacpp/models/` directory.

To start using AI, do the following:
1. Run the AI starter file with the command `sh start.sh` in the `libyunacpp/` directory to start the Yuna model.
2. Run `python index.py` command in the main directory to start the WebUI.
3. Double-click the `index.html` file in the directory or run it via Live Server.
4. Done!

## Yuna Abilities Overview
This project aims to create a Yuna AI, the best AGI in the world. The critical components of Yuna:

1. **Support for Video and Audio Calls**:
   Yuna AI offers a native web UI for seamless video and audio calls, enhancing your communication experience.

2. **Image Processing and Creation**:
   Yuna can process images and create drawings, adding a creative touch to your interactions.

3. **Emotion Understanding**:
   Yuna has a full range of emotions, allowing her to understand and display emotions realistically.

4. **Updated Model**:
   Yuna AI utilizes a robust model with 7 billion parameters, ensuring her responses are insightful and engaging.

5. **Hardware Acceleration**:
   Yuna supports CUDA GPU and CPU MacOS MPS acceleration for smooth performance.

6. **Native Telegram API**:
   Communicate with Yuna through the native API, enabling calls and text interactions via Telegram.

7. **Web App Support (PWA)**:
   Yuna AI can be accessed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for convenient use across different devices.

8. **Kawai Framework**:
   The CSS and JS of Yuna's interface have been rewritten using the Kawai Framework for a visually appealing design.

9. **Platform Compatibility**:
   Yuna AI is adapted to run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows, ensuring cross-platform support.

10. **Web User Interface (WebUI)**
   The WebUI is set up using Flask, a web framework for Python. It handles HTTP requests and responses to enable communication between the user and the AI model. The code provided starts a Flask application that listens on port 4848.

## Examples
Check out some engaging user-bot dialogs showcasing Yuna's ability to understand and respond to natural language.

```
User: Hello, Yuna! How are you today?
Yuna: Hi, I am fine! I'm so happy to meet you today. How about you?
```
