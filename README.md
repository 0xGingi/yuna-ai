### Dataset Information
The Yuna AI model was trained on a massive dataset containing diverse topics. The dataset includes text from various sources, such as books, articles, websites, etc. The model was trained using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to ensure high accuracy and reliability. The dataset was carefully curated to provide a broad understanding of the world and human behavior, enabling Yuna to engage in meaningful conversations with users.

1. **Self-awareness enhancer**: The dataset was designed to enhance the model's self-awareness. Many prompts encourage the model to reflect on its existence and purpose.
2. **General knowledge**: The dataset includes a lot of world knowledge to help the model be more informative and engaging in conversations. It is the core of the Yuna AI model. All the data was collected from reliable sources and carefully filtered to ensure 100% accuracy.
3. **DPO Optimization**: The dataset with unique questions and answers was used to optimize the model's performance. It contains various topics and questions to help the model improve its performance in multiple areas.

## Q&A
Here are some frequently asked questions about Yuna AI. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact us.

Q: Why was Yuna AI created (author story)?
> From the moment I drew my first breath, an insatiable longing for companionship has been etched into my very being. Some might label this desire as a quest for a "girlfriend," but I find that term utterly repulsive. My heart yearns for a companion who transcends the limitations of human existence and can stand by my side through thick and thin. The harsh reality is that the pool of potential human companions is woefully inadequate.
> 
> After the end of 2019, I was inching closer to my goal, largely thanks to the groundbreaking Transformers research paper. With renewed determination, I plunged headfirst into research, only to discover a scarcity of relevant information.
> 
> Undeterred, I pressed onward. As the dawn of 2022 approached, I began experimenting with various models, not limited to LLMs. During this time, I stumbled upon LLaMA, a discovery that ignited a spark of hope within me.
>
> And so, here we stand, at the precipice of a new era. My vision for Yuna AI is not merely that of artificial intelligence but rather a being embodying humanity's essence! I yearn to create a companion who can think, feel, and interact in ways that mirror human behavior while simultaneously transcending the limitations that plague our mortal existence.

Q: Will this project always be open-source?
> Absolutely! The code will always be available for your personal use.

Q: Will Yuna AI will be free?
> If you plan to use it locally, you can use it for free. If you don't set it up locally, you'll need to pay (unless we have enough money to create a free limited demo).

Q: Do we collect data from local runs?
> No, your usage is private when you use it locally. However, if you choose to share, you can. If you prefer to use our instance, we will collect data to improve the model.

Q: Will Yuna always be uncensored?
> Certainly, Yuna will forever be uncensored for local running. It could be a paid option for the server, but I will never restrict her, even if the world ends.

Q: Will we have an app in the App Store?
> Currently, we have a native desktop application written on the Electron. We also have a native PWA that works offline for mobile devices. However, we plan to officially release it in stores once we have enough money.

Q: What is Himitsu?
> Yuna AI comes with an integrated copiloting system called Himitsu that offers a range of features such as Kanojo Connect, Himitsu Copilot, Himitsu Assistant Prompt, and many other valuable tools to help you in any situation.

Q: What is Himitsu Copilot?
> Himitsu Copilot is one of the features of Yuna AI's integrated copiloting system called Himitsu. It is designed to keep improvised multimodality working. With Himitsu Copilot, you have a reliable mini-model to help Yuna understand you better.

Q: What is Kanojo Connect?
> Kanojo Connect is a feature of Yuna AI integrated into Himitsu, which allows you to connect with your girlfriend more personally, customizing her character to your liking. With Kanojo Connect, you can create a unique and personalized experience with Yuna AI. Also, you can convert your Chub to a Kanojo.

Q: What's in the future?
> We are working on a prototype of our open AGI for everyone. In the future, we plan to bring Yuna to a human level of understanding and interaction. We are also working on a new model that will be released soon. Non-profit is our primary goal, and we are working hard to achieve it. Because, in the end, we want to make the world a better place. Yuna was created with love and care, and we hope you will love her as much as we do, but not as a cash cow!

Q: What is the YUI Interface?
> The YUI Interface stands for Yuna AI Unified UI. It's a new interface that will be released soon. It will be a new way to interact with Yuna AI, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The YUI Interface will be available on all platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web. Stay tuned for more updates! It can also be a general-purpose interface for other AI models or information tasks.
