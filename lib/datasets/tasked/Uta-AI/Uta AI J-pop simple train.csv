Title,Lyrics
Drink dry tears love pain destiny enough half selfless love and said anyway crazy shadows,"Inexperienced and heartless, but be beautiful
No Destiny, unworthy
I'm sure this is not enough
If you talk about it, it will go well
Things, money, love, words, I'm tired of showing off
Déjà vu What's so frustrating?
What more do you need than this?
I don't hate places like that
""I'm tired of hearing that line""
I hate being half-hearted
enough
You said like this
love how she I was told
If it's just for fun, it's easy, serious negotiations are unreasonable
Unthinkable light words
How many times do you use it?
Anyway
I was expecting it, even if it was a good race
Phrases full of quotes
Make words that lift your heels taboo
I read the air, don't let it rain
I don't like boring stories
Please use the minimum required number of 2 characters or less
Crimson Butterfly does not send any mail
Spreading a fragile fan, she would be more attractive that way
in confusion
If you can't respond, leave me alone
If you're at a loss, please leave
The most important thing is that you can just let go and feel at ease
If it rains sweet candy
You want an umbrella too, don't you?
like this
I closed my eyes
I wanted to change, pretending to be grown-up
I lost it, I couldn't rewind it
Don't stop raining now
copy paste delete repeat
inhaled and exhaled
that's why
I don't care, I want to stay here
enough
You said like this
love how she I was told
If it's just for fun, it's easy, serious negotiations are incoherent
The unthinkable heavy truth
Shouldn't it be taboo?
surely
I was expecting it, even if it was a good race
Official phrases too
Stop the habit of raising your heels
Don't let the sky clear when you read the air
rain again today
Close your umbrella and let's go home wet"
Without heart broken love tears kill mine lovely loneliness easier crying close and hug chose,"Hey, if everything is thrown away
Does laughing make life easier?
My chest hurts again
don't say anything anymore
Hey, if everything is forgotten
Will it be easier to live without crying?
But I can't do that
don't show me anything anymore
no matter how close i get to you
i only have one heart
It's cruel, it's cruel, I'd rather take my body
Break it, tear it apart, do whatever you want
Even if I scream and struggle and my eyelids swell
You still hug me and won't let go
that's enough
Hey, if my wish could come true
i want the same thing as you
But I don't exist
Then at least come here
no matter how much i love you
i only have one heart
Stop it, stop it, don't be nice
I just can't understand
It hurts, it hurts, tell me in words
I don't know this, don't leave me alone
It's cruel, it's cruel, I'd rather take my body
Break it, tear it apart, do whatever you want
Even if I scream, scratch my eyes, and swell my eyelids
You still hug me and won't let go
that's enough
Hey, if I have a heart
how do i find it
you smile a little and say
it's right here"
Irony make up funny mystery life live touch me dark side walking though me with time and hope,"I'm a little tired from walking
It's a mediocre expression
The long road called life
i need some rest
I want to rest for a while
Time is cruel every moment
you're pulling me
I hope it goes well
It's just that I'm not good at it
I feel like crying carelessly
pathetic really
I feel miserable
I've tasted it enough to hate it
It's been a while since I regretted it
I should have thrown it away
to despair
it's not bad
what you want
always a little out of reach
What is she like?
because I expect
then better yet
Push me down to the bottom
I was told no answer
Some people switch
So absolutely never
i can't believe
Hey everyone has pain
Why do you know that?
Then should I just smile?
i don't know anymore
fool!
Even though I've been told so many times
why she's not bad
It's easy if you think about it easily
I was thinking hard
It's getting more and more troublesome
Shall I end it calmly?
""Are you sick?""
I don't like it anymore
Isn't it enough if it ends gently?
dream or hope
the meaning of being alive
Except for that kind of thing
I don't need it
specific
easy to understand
give me a chance
While looking for a place to cry
I'm tired of crying
Because I hate being pretty
Even if I have high hopes, nothing will come of it
""The stars are watching over us""
there's only night
Hey, that gentle side of you
I'll ask you unconsciously
This soft-hearted cousin
don't touch me anymore
Yada!
leave me alone
keep it
This dirty road
I won't change anymore ah
I'm tired and weak
ran away
it's useless
So cover your ears inside
Cry at least
what is life
Even if I don't understand, I'm just living
Should I feel happy?
i don't know anymore"
Cool funny today sun to be aware around forever see you tomorrow want you amazed light,"I don't like you because you're cool
It's cool because I like it
It's okay to be ridiculed by someone
'Cause my ""hero""
Even though you always say ""I'm sleepy""
Are you saying that class is happening?
cool in front of everyone
Are you lazy in front of a dog?
Ah, about you who I truly love
Be my own ""hero""
I want to do LINE
i want to go home with you
To you who go to after school activities
Saying ""See you later"" to yourself
I want to see you even on my day off
I want to make a phone call when I fall asleep
I don't have the courage to do that
I'm amazed
I want you to turn around
I want you to be aware
put on perfume
choking alone
i want you
i want to be yours
""Tomorrow will come""
simulation in bed
thinking of you
see you tomorrow
I don't like you because you're cute
I love you so you're cute
It's okay to be ridiculed by someone
Because my ""heroine""
Even though you say, ""Today is the time to wake up!""
I'm going to sleep in class after all
I'm a tomboy in front of everyone
Are you unexpectedly prone to tears?
Ah, I really love you so much
Won't you become my own ""heroine""?
I want to teach you how to study
I want to go see a movie with you
To you laughing with your friends after school
Saying ""bye bye"" to myself
I want to be in your story
I want to brag about ""my girlfriend""
I don't think I can confess
I'm amazed
I want you to turn around
I want you to be aware
put on wax
I got sticky
i want you
i want to be yours
""Tomorrow will come""
Simulation in the futon
thinking of you
see you tomorrow
I gave you your advice
you've been talking about men
don't say ""stop""
don't go to another man
I've been watching you forever
I want you to turn around
I want you to be aware
Will you stay by my side forever
i like you
i love you
""Tomorrow will come""
Simulation today
love with you
It smelled like sweet musk"
