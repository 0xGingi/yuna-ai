Title,Lyrics
Friends love last tonight suddenly notice happy too be with hand in rest,"If I could replace your sorrow
i want to stay by her side
Two shadows with their heels aligned
I'm so tall
She looks like Cecil in the movies
I don't want to lie
People get weaker as they grow older
I suddenly lose my confidence and get lost
That's why I'm looking for love that's more than friends
I wish I could be him tonight
Just by changing the hand that rests on your cheek
you don't speak anything
call yourself by your last name
I'm quiet as usual
I suddenly notice your tears
I pretended not to see
Love is more sad than happy
It will last longer if it starts softly
I'm sure everyone has at least one ally
i wish i could always be that
People get weaker as they grow older
I suddenly lose my confidence and get lost
That's why I'm looking for love that's more than friends
i wish i could be that tonight
People get weaker as they grow older
I suddenly lose my confidence and get lost
That's why I'm looking for love that's more than friends
i wish i could be that tonight"
Friends fun make stuff country dance happy to be here fires good for me,"Jack makes good whiskey, yeah
Red dirt makes good ridin' roads
Country makes good music
For kickin' up dust in a tail light glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good but for me
God makes five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
He Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
Oh God makes the good stuff
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes
God makes five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
God made her so I will make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me
When he made five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff
Five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey but God makes the good stuff (oh)
Yeah, God makes the good stuff
Yeah, God makes the good stuff (oh)
Whoa"
