Story: The Lamp At Noon
Title of Essay: How oneâ€™s environment can influence  their decisions?
---

The human mind is complex; it holds our consciousness, personality, thoughts, and feelings. It governs our behavior, guides our decisions, and shapes our experiences. Our surroundings play a significant role in this complex system, influencing how we perceive the world and make choices. Social persuasions like family can significantly impact our choices. For instance, regarding career choices, which is our future, some families may influence their children to pursue a specific profession, such as medicine or law, based on their beliefs and values. However, what needs to be understood are the environmental factors that can also affect our decisions. Life's choices can be different for individuals in the same environment.

The dust storms that relentlessly strike Paul and Ellen's small farm isolate them physically and emotionally. For instance, "A little before noon, she lit the lamp" shows that sometimes, in moments of crisis, people make decisions that defy logic and reason. The reason for this might lie in their environment, emotional state, or the pressing nature of the circumstances. Commonly, there is no need to turn on a lamp at noon, when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. The "demented wind" and "impenetrable fog" of dust enveloping their land sever their connections to community and nature. This isolation, coupled with fear and desperation, prompts her to take a desperate chance for survival, even at the cost of losing her baby.

Ellen feels trapped and longs to flee the storms and uncertainty. Her environment has warped her optimism into a "plaintive indignation" and a "nervous dread of what was still to come." The dust infiltrates the very lungs of her infant son, causing him to cry incessantly. The desperation of their situation is palpable, and helplessness engulfs her. Convinced that this place will only destroy their health and dreams, Ellen begs Paul to abandon the failing farm. She sees his determination to hold on as a sign of stubbornness and greed. Nevertheless, her desperate wish for escape beat her judgment of Paul's resilience. Our settings often shape our mindsets - Ellen's bleak landscape fuels her hopelessness about the future.

However, Paul's decision to stay, influenced by an environmental factor, indicates his attachment to the land and belief, showing his vision of a brighter future, but not separate from their current hardships. His positive perspective contrasts with Ellen's, leading to conflicts and an ultimate stalemate. As the story progresses, the environmental impact becomes more apparent. After the storm, Paul realizes the extent of the damage he caused by being too stubborn, triggering a transformative journey where he must confront his internal environmental factors and make amends.

In conclusion, it is intriguing to consider the perplexing ways in which our surroundings can shape our decisions. The profound influence of the environment was evident in the actions of both Paul and Ellen in the face of adversity, leaving us to ponder the mysterious forces that govern the human psyche, sometimes even dictating their life's course. Hence, it is crucial to be aware of these influences and take measures to counteract them, if need be - because our environment shapes who we are, what we desire, and what course of action we take. It is one of the main lessons we must learn from the captivating tale hidden in the narrative of "The Lamp at Noon." Therefore, the integrity of our world will open our eyes to something we all yearn for: the true reason for existence!
